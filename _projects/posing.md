abstract: "Next to lighting, posing is the most challenging aspect of portrait photography. A commonly adopted solution is to learn by example, which is beneficial for both trained photographers and novice users, especially when subjects have no clue about how to pose themselves. A collection of portrait images by professionals (e.g., [Perkins 2009]) provides a resource for photographers seeking inspiration for their own work. Such handful posing references (e.g., Posing App) have also been made available to smartphone platforms, which offer the unique possibility of directly overlaying camera view with a reference pose as visual guidance."
