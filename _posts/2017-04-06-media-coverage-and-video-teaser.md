# {{ page.title }}
My recent research on color palette got covered in MIT Technology Review. Here is the link to [the article](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/604026/the-algorithm-expanding-the-science-of-color/). I have uploaded the teaser video to [youtube](https://youtu.be/77B7cEaf9Ug).

You can also find a copy of the related paper in this arxiv [link](http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06003).
